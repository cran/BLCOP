New in version 0.2.6:
- No new functionality was added.  The package has simply been updated to build correctly under R 2.13.0.

New in version 0.2.4:
- Made corrections to the vignette, added examples using the new optimalPortfolios.fPort functionality
- Added several extractor functions, including posteriorMeanCov, posteriorSimulations, numSimulations, 
  and priorViews
- Added optimalPortfolios.fPort generic function.  This function wraps fPortfolio functionality to allow
  one to see the impact of view blending on optimal portfolios, and is meant to replace the old "toy"
  optimizer.  
- The BLPosterior function now allows one to choose which function is used for covariance estimation
- The "alphas" parameter for BLPosterior was renamed to "mu" for consistency with other Rmetrics naming 
  conventions 
- densityPlots function generates an error when called on a class for which no method exists
- densityPlots COPResults method allows one to select assets by name, not just numeric index
- Modified the "show" method for objects of class BLViews, added a simple "show" method for COPResults
  class objects
- Renamed "runBLCOPTestSuite" to "runBLCOPTests", added several enhancements including the ability
  to generate an RUnit HTML report
